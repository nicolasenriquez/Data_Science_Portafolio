    "If we don't set the `NOT NULL` parameter, nothing is stoping us to insert an explicit null value as so `INSERT(client_name, client_last_name, age) VALUES(NULL, NULL, 59)`, this will force the `NULL` values into the table.\n",

    "So setting both parameters, `NOT NULL` and `DEFAULT` as set in the example, if we try to insert a `NULL` value, it will raise an `Error` and not a warning, meaning that we cannot append a `NULL` value because in that particular columns they are not allowed.\n",

    "### Table Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the primary key of a table is to make each and every row of the dataset recognizable from one another, even if they look the same. In general, an `Id` column is created and each instance/row of the dataset is linked a unique number, and that number (in this case is the id) makes every row easily recognizable from one another, this later used for more advance SQL code such as link two tables (more on this later).\n",

    "        - If we see this in a storage wise situation, since the VARCHAR has a flexible amount of characters it can store, the storage in bytes it required is variable for every string with this data type. For example, if we use a string with less than 4 characters long, and assuming that each character is equal to 1 byte, will have a 4 byte storage. But if we have a 10 character long string, it will require a storage capacity of 10 bytes, and if we use an empty string it will require a storage of 0 bytes, and so on, untill it reaches the maximum capacity of 255 characters, that would mean a storage capacity of 255 bytes for that string.\n",

    "### Types of Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One to One Relationship**: This kind of relationship ensures there is strictly a one-to-one link between them (goes both ways), this means that for example, considering id's and people, 2 persons cannot have the same identification number (id), meaning that, one person is directly linked to a unique identification number, and the same way around, an identification number can only trace back to a unique inidividual.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\rightleftharpoons_{\\text{1}}^{\\text{1}} Y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One to Many Relationship (the most common)**: This kind of relationship says that in one way, it's strctly a one-to-one relation, but on the other way around there can be many connections or links. For example, suppose the scenario of a person and celphones, one person can have many smartphones (for instance 2 phones), but each of the 2 smartphones have a unique owner. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\rightleftharpoons_{N}^{1} Y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Many to Many Relationship**: This kind of relationships says that for both ways, there is a many-to-many relation. Let's see the next example, in the field of books, one author can write many books, and also, one book can have several authors, so this is a perfect example of a many to many relationship between books and authors.\n",

    "Suppose a scenario where you have the customers and the orders placed by those customers via the online shopping website. In this can see that the relationship between customer and orders is one to many, because one single customer can place as many orders as they like, but every order is linked to a unique buyer / customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we would like to save the information of the customers and the orders in only one table it can be done, but it will have alot of duplicated data, we may have NULL values from customers that have not done any purchasing, as we can see in the table example below:\n",
