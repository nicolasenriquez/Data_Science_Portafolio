# Week 2 - Supervised Machine Learning Part 1

In this folder you'll find the Jupyter Notebooks related to the third week of the course, in this section we are going to study a variety of supervised learning methods for both classification and regression, the importance of proper feature scaling, how to control model complexity by applying techniques like regularization to avoid overfitting, and covers linear regression (ordinary least-squares, ridge, lasso, polynomial regression), logistic regression, support vector machines, the use of cross-validation for model evaluation, and decision trees.
