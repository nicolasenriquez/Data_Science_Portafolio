# Third Course - Applied Machine Learning in Python

Introduction to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods rather than on the statistics and math behind these algorithms. By completing the course the following skills are seen as follows: understand the difference between a supervised (regression or classification) and unsupervised (clustering) machine learning technique, identify which technique to apply for a particular dataset, and write code to elaborate an analysis.
