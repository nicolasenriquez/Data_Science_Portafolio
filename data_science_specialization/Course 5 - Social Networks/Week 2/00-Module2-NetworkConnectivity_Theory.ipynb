    "- What edges are likely to come to the network next?\n",
    "- What edges are likely to arrive?\n",

    "However, we don't always have time stamps, or we don't always know the ordering in which the edges come into the network. Sometimes, we're just given a static network with no time stamps, and sometimes, we want to know whether Triadic Closure is present in this network, whether it has lots of triangles or not. And so, what we're going to be talking about is how to measure the prevalence of Triadic Closure in a network\n",

    "So, let's say, you wanted to compute the Clustering Coefficient of node C. What you would need to do is to take the ratio of the number of pairs of C's friends who are friends with each other, and the total number of pairs of C's friends. So, C has four friends in this network. That means that C has a degree of four. That's what we refer to as degree. It's the number of connections that a node has. And, we refer to it as DC as well. So, DC here, which the degree of C is four. Now, how many pairs of C's friends are there? Well, there are four friends of C, and you can easily see that, if you have four pairs of four people, then there are six total possible pairs of people. And so, the total number of pairs of C's friends is six. Now, this is easy to see because there is only four friends of C, but sometimes, there are many more and it might be harder to see how many possible pairs of friends you have. So, what you can do is you can just use this formula here which tells you how many. It's dc times dc-1 over two. In this case, that number is six, which is 12 or 2.\n",

Well, there are only two pairs of friends of C that are friends with each other. AB and EF. So, that number is two. So then, the Local Clustering Coefficient of node C is two over six or one-third. That means that one-third of all the possible pairs of friends of C who could be friends, are actually friends. Okay. Let's do another example. Compute the Local Clustering Coefficient of node F. Again, we need to compute the ratio of the number of pairs of F's friends who are friends with each other, and the total number of pairs of F's friends. So, we'll do the same thing here. F has a degree of three. So, the number of pairs of F's friends is three times two over two which is three. And then, there's only one pair of friends of F who are actually friends with each other.

    "- Are there are differences between the two? \n",

    "Well, it turns out that there are differences between the two. They **both try to measure the tendency for the edges to form triangles**, but it turns out the Transitivity weights the nodes with a larger number of connections higher. It weights the nodes with a larger degree higher. The best way to see that is by looking at examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, imagine a graph that kind of looks like a wheel with one node in the center and a pair of nodes connected at different places of the clock, forming one pair of nodes friend connection for the 3 nodes. If you look at this graph closely, you'll find that** most nodes actually have a pretty high Local Clustering Coefficient**. So, all the nodes that are on the outside of the wheel have a Local Clustering Coefficient of one because, each one of these nodes, you see that it has two connections. So, he has one pair friends, and that pair friend is connected. So, this node here has a Local Clustering Coefficient of one and the same is true for all the nodes on the outside of the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, most nodes have a high Local Clustering Coefficient. However, if you consider the node inside the wheel, the central node, that one has a pretty high degree but it has a very low Clustering Coefficient. **That is because it has many, many connections in many pairs of connections and only a few of those are actually connected to each other, but most of them are not connected**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, these two nodes are not connected,these two nodes are not connected, these two nodes are not connected and so on. Even though all of them are friends with that central node. So, **in this graph, the average Clustering Coefficient is pretty high, it's 0.93 because most nodes have a very high Local Clustering Coefficient, except for one. However, the Transitivity of this network is 0.23. And that's because Transitivity weights the nodes with high degree higher**. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so, in this network, there's **one node with a very high degree compared to the others that has a very small Local Clustering Coefficient compared to the others, and Transitivity penalizes that. So, you get a much lower Transitivity**\n",

So what we're going to do is we're going to start at A and we're going to start discovering new nodes as we kind of walk through this network. And we're going to be writing down all the nodes that we discover. So we start at A and we sort of process the node A by looking at who is connected to A. In this case, K and B are connected to A and so those are going to be a distance one away because they're the shortest path from each one of those nodes to A it's just one hop, right? A path of length one. Okay, so now we're going to process each one of the newly discovered nodes and ask which nodes are connected to this newly discovered node that we haven't discovered yet? And those nodes are going to be assigned to the next layer. So let's say we process node B. Node B is connected to K, A and C. But we've already discovered nodes A and K, so the only node that we discover here is node C. Now we're going to process node K, and node K is connected to node A and B, but we've already discovered both of those. So the only newly discovered node is node C and it's a distance two away from A. Now we process node C which is connected to B, F, and E. And here we've already discovered B so the only two nodes that we discover are F and E and those are a distance three away from A. Okay, now we're going to process node E. Okay, node E has five connections and out of those five, C and F we already discovered. So the only new ones are the other three which are D, I and H. So we assign those to the next layer. Now we process node F which is connected to three nodes G, C and E. But the only one we haven't discovered yet out of all those is G so I want this to get assigned to the next layer. And all of those nodes are a distance four away from A. Okay, now we have to process each one of those newly discovered nodes, and by now you can see that we're already almost done here. So let's process node D which is only connected to E. But we've already discovered E so D does not discover any new nodes. Now let's go with I. I is connected to E and J. And we haven't discovered J yet, so this one it's assigned to the next layer. Next we process H which is only connected to E but we already discovered E. And finally, we process G which is connected to F which you've already discovered. So, J is a distance five away. All right? We have to process J, but J is only connected to I which we already discovered and now we're done. We've processed all the nodes. There are no new nodes to discover.\n",

    "We've defined the distance between any two pair of nodes in a network, but if we go back to the original questions we had, in the beginning, we were interested in, we're characterizing the distances between all pairs of nodes in the graph. Our nodes in general are close to each other, or are they far away from each other. If some are close and some are far, then how can we figure out which are close and which are far and so on? And so, now, we're going to try to answer these questions.\n",

    "#### Average Distance between every pair of Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "The first first approach we can do, is you can simply **take the average distance between every pair of nodes in the network**. So, that tells you what's on average the distance. In `NetworkX` we can do that by using the function `average_shortest_path_length()`.\n",

    "The other thing that is useful to define is the eccentricity of a node. The **eccentricity of a node is the largest distance between the node and all the other nodes in the network**. So, you take a node, measure the distance from the node to all the other nodes, and figure out which one of those instances is the largest one of all.

    "\n",
    "So, for the first approach, we have the **periphery, which is the set of nodes in a graph that have an eccentricity equals to the diameter of the network**, which is sort of the largest eccentricity that you could have, since the diameter is the largest distance between any two nodes in the network.

    "Why is 34 not showing up in the center? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, it turns out that if we look carefully, node 34 has a distance four to node 17, right? To get from 34 to 17, you have to go 34, 32, 16, and 17, and so, it couldn't be in the center because the radius of the graph is three and this one has a node that is the distance four away from it. Now, it turns out that actually if this node 17 was just a bit closer, for example, if this node 17 was a distance three away from 34, then 34 would actually be in the center, because 34 is a distance at most three to every other node in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, **this shows that this definition of center is pretty sensitive to just one node that happens to be far away**. So, if you make a very small change to a graph that makes a particular node far further away from the other, you can sort of make it or break it for the node to be in the center or not. \n",

    "Let's start with the concept of **connected**. The first type is we're going to say that a direct graph is strongly connected if for every pair of nodes, say U and V, there is a directed path that goes from U to V and another directed path that goes from V to U. That, if a directed graph has this property, then we say it's **strongly connected**.\n",

And now, you ask the question that you already applied to undirected graphs, is this graph connected or not? And if it is, then we say that the original directed graph is weakly connected**. So in this case, if we use the function `is_weakly_connected()` from `NetworkX` would say yes, this graph is weakly connected because once you turn it into an undirected graph, this undirected graph is connected.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary, in this video, we've talked about node connectivity, and that is the minimum number of nodes that you need in order to disconnect a graph or disconnect a particular pair of nodes. The functions associated with node connectivity are `node_connectivity()`, which tells us the smallest number of nodes that you need in order to achieve that, and `minimum_node_cut()` which actually tells us which are those nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node Connectivity**: Minimum number of nodes needed to disconnect a graph or a pair of nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# minimum number of nodes that you need in order to disconnect a graph\n",
    "nx.node_connectivity(G, 'G', 'L')\n",
    "\n",
    "# smallest number of nodes that you need in order to achieve the disconnection\n",
    "nx.minimum_node_cut(G, 'G', 'L')\n",
    "```\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "Then, you have a similar definition for edge connectivity, which is the minimum number of edges that you need in order to disconnect the graph, or to disconnect any pair of nodes. The functions they use are `edge_connectivity()` and `minimum_edge_cut()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edge Connectivity**: Minimum number of edges needed to disconnect a graph or a pair of nodes \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# minimum number of nodes that you need in order to disconnect a graph\n",
    "nx.edge_connectivity(G, 'G', 'L')\n",
    "\n",
    "# smallest number of nodes that you need in order to achieve the disconnection\n",
    "nx.minimum_edge_cut(G, 'G', 'L')\n",
    "```\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "And the takeaway here is that **graphs with large node or large edge connectivity are more robust to the loss of nodes and edges. They're able to keep their connectivity even if some number of edges and nodes are removed from the network**. And for many applications, this is a very desirable property for networks to have."
