It's called PageRank and it was developed by the Google founders when they were thinking about how to measure the importance of webpages using the hyperlink network structure of the web.\n",
    "\n",

So the ways it's defined sounds a little bit circular. And in this lecture, we're going to walk through the process of how you can actually compute it.\n",

And so at first, we're going to start with every node having a PageRank value of $\\frac{1}{n}$. And then what we're going to do is we're going to have every node give all of its PageRank to all the nodes that it points to, and then were going to do this over and over again.\n",

    "So you should have figured out that for large enough k, F and G are going to have a PageRank value of about one half. And all the other nodes are going to have a PageRank value of 0. So, why is that? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, imagine a random walk on this network. Whenever the random walk lands on F or G, which will happen eventually if you walk long enough on this network, then they're going to stock on F and G because there are no edges to go to, right? So if you're in G, the only place you have to go is F. And if you are in F, the only place you have to go to is G. So, there's no way to get back from G and F to any of the other notes. And so all the other nodes, a probability that you land on one of them after taking a very long random walk is going to be 0, and the probability of landing on either F or G after a very long random walk is going to be about half for each. And so this seems like a problem, because while it may be true that F and G are very important for this reason, it's not reasonable to think that all the other nodes have zero importance. We need to figure out a way of how to fix this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we fix this problem is by introducing a new parameter to the PageRank computation called this *\"damping parameter\" alpha ($\\alpha$)*. And so what we're going to do is we're going to change the way we do our random walk. What we're going to do is we're going to take a random walk with the *\"damping\" parameter $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way it works is that we again start at a random node. And then with probability $\\alpha$, we're going to follow the outgoing edges at random, just like we did before, but this is only going to happen with probability $\\alpha$. Then, with probability $(1 - \\alpha)$, we're actually going to choose a node completely at random and jump to it. So again, at every step, what we used to do before was to always follow the edges. **What we're going to do now is that at every step, we're either going to follow the edges with probability $(\\alpha)$, or we are going to forget about the edges, and choose a random node, and go to it with probability $(1 - \\alpha)$, and we're going to repeat this k times**. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so what happens now, if you think about the random walk on this particular network as an example, is that we're no longer stuck on nodes F and G, right? because even if we were to be on node F and G, we have some probability $(1 - \\alpha)$ of choosing a random node, then we're going to get unstuck whenever we actually choose a random node.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so the **Scaled PageRank of k steps with damping parameter alpha of a node n is going to be the probability that this new random walk with damping parameter alpha lands on a node and after k steps**.\n",

So, what that does is that it allows the walker to not be stuck anywhere, but sometimes it's sort of jumping randomly. And typically, we use a perimeter alpha between 0.8 and 0.9. But we do have to keep in mind that the PageRank value that we get will depend on the particular choice of alpha. \n",

    "In this lecture we're going to talk about another way to find central nodes in the network. Just like PageRank, this way was also developed in the context of how a search engine might go about finding important web pages given a query using the hyperlink structure of the web. So the first step will be to find a set of relevant webpages. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, web pages that contain the query string in the text of the web page or for some reason the search engine thinks these might be an important page to look at. So **these are potential authorities, potential pages that are important given the query that the user submitted. This will be called the root set**. And so let's say in this example that nodes A, B, and C are these potential authorities, this is the root set. And **the next step will be to find all the web pages that link to any page in the root set, and these pages will be potential hubs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "So **hubs are pages that are not themselves necessarily relevant to the query that the user submitted, but they link to pages that are relevant**. So they're pages that are good at pointing at things that may be relevant.\n",

    "Now, the **difference between HITS and PageRank** is that the **HITS algorithm is going to keep track of two kinds of scores for every node, the Authority score and the Hub score**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to give every node an authority and a hub score of 1, and then we're going to apply two different rules. These rules are going to be similar to the rules that we used when we computed PageRank, but again now we're going to have to keep track of two different scores. So the first rule is going to be the Authority Update Rule, which says that each node's authority score is going to be the sum of the hub scores of each node that points to that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing *k* iterations of the HITS alorithm to assign an *Authority score* and a *Hub score* to each node in the network:\n",
    "1. Assing each node an Authority and a Hub Score of 1\n",
    "2. Apply the **Authority Update Rule :** Each node's **<font color='red'>authority score</font>**  is the sum of the **<font color='red'>hubs scores</font>** of each node that **<font color='red'>it points to</font>**\n",
    "3. Apply the **Hubs Update Rule :** Each node's **<font color='red'>hubs score</font>**  is the sum of the **<font color='red'>authority scores</font>** of each node that **<font color='red'>it points to</font>**\n",
    "4. **Normalize** the Authority Score and the Hub Score:\n",
    "$$authority(j) = \\frac{authority(j)}{\\sum_{i \\in N}{authority(i)}}$$\n",
    "5. Repeat the process *k* times\n",
    "\n",
    "$$$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can see at this point that what we're really doing when we get this **new authority score is looking at the in-degree of each one of the nodes** (in-degrees are the edges from a directed graph going from the other nodes and pointing towards the specific node).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move to the **new hub scores. It's going to be very similar, but now instead of looking at the in-degree of every node, we're going to look at the out-degree**. (out-degrees are the edges from a directed graph going from the other nodes and pointing outwards the specific node)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have to **normalize, and so, to normalize we have to add up the authority scores and add up the hub scores**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so if we do that we normalize the scores. And now the new authority and hub scores are going to become our old scores and that's the end of the first iteration $(k = 1)$, and with the new scores are used to repeat the same process and begin the 2nd iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that in the **first iteration, every authority and hub score for every node in the network had the value of 1**, but now, **after the first iteration and the normalization, every node may have different scores from the rest of the nodes**, so it's important to be careful from this point forward, calculation wise.\n",

    "So, if we summarize the whole document, we find that no pair of centrality measures produces the exact same ranking but there are some commonalities, so you are able to pick out some of the nodes that are very central. Of course, the centrality measures make different assumptions about what it means to be a central node. And so, that's why they produce different rankings. And **to figure out what the best centrality measure is, really depends on the context of the network** that you're analyzing. And usually, the **best thing to do to identify central nodes is to take up multiples centrality measures and figure out which nodes come out central in many of them rather than relying on a single one to do this**.\n",
